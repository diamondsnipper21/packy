Admin hereby authorizes Packy to charge Admin's payment method (as specified below), in advance, for the amount of Admin's regular subscription fees, inclusive of any and all Services that Admin has signed up for (collectively, “Subscription Fees”), for each agreed term of the Admin's selected subscription term. Admin hereby authorizes Packy to modify the Subscription Fees charged for a selected subscription term upon thirty (30) days’ notice to Admin sent by e-mail to the address provided on registration. The Subscription Fees, when paid, are non-refundable and accrue on the first day of each term or successive renewal term until canceled, regardless of whether or not the Admin actually uses the Site or the Services. Various Services on the Site, whether offered by Packy, third-party service providers or others, may require additional fees or charges not included within a subscription.<br /><br />Admin is required to pay all charges on time and agrees to submit an accompanying payment authorization in connection with these charges when requested by Packy. Packy may terminate or disable Admin's subscription if Admin fails to pay fully and in a timely manner all amounts due to Packy. If Admin's payment method expires or is otherwise declined for payment, access to the Services and the Site may be modified, suspended or cancelled, in Packy's sole discretion and without notice to Admin. All fees are quoted and payable in United States Dollars. Admin is also responsible for paying all applicable taxes for Services and/or Content, and any other costs incurred in connection with the use of or access to the Site or its Services.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Payment Methods.</span> Admin agrees to the <a href=\"/legal/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a> when providing any necessary personal information for the purposes of processing payment for a Packy subscription. Packy may use third-party service providers for payment processing. In such cases, the third-party payment processor’s terms and conditions apply. Please review these third-party terms and conditions before completing payment.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Subscription Term; Auto Renewal.</span> Subscriptions are normally assessed on a monthly or annual basis, but other Services and their respective billing arrangements may be made available to Admins at Packy's sole discretion. The Subscription Fees are calculated from the day upon which Admin's paid Subscription commences. From time to time and at its sole discretion, Packy may offer different subscription terms on its Site, and the fees for such subscriptions may vary. The term of Admin's access to the Site, Services and Content is based upon Admin's express agreement and adherence to these Terms and to Admin's fully paid subscription and/or other fees. <b>Admin's subscription to the Site shall be for the initial term (e.g., monthly or annually) as may be agreed by Admin and Packy through online registration and shall automatically renew for indefinite successive renewal terms for the same period as the initial term, unless terminated by Admin or Packy in accordance with the provisions of these Terms.</b><br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Cancellation.</span> Either Packy or Admin may cancel Admin’s Subscription at any time for any reason (unless otherwise stated in an applicable promotional offer). In the event of cancellation by Packy or by Admin, all fees due to Packy up to the end of the then-current term billing cycle at time of cancellation shall remain payable to Packy. No refunds will be provided for partial billing periods, unless otherwise specifically stated in an applicable promotional offer. Upon cancellation, Admin will retain access to Packy through the end of Admin’s billing period. After the end of such billing period, Admin’s group will be archived, whereas then-current content will be available on a read-only basis, and no new content may be added.<br /><br />Admins may cancel their subscription by any of the methods below:<br /><ul class=\"pl-1-5\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>Sign into Admin’s Packy account, click on “Settings” and click on “Billing” then “Cancel Subscription”; or</li><li>Send a cancellation request via email to <a href=\"#contact_mail#\">#contact_mail#</a></li></ul><br />If at any time Packy believes, in its sole discretion, that an Admin has violated any provision of these Terms, Packy may immediately terminate that Admin’s Subscription and all other Services without any refund or other remedy, and all fees due to Packy up to the end of the then-current billing cycle at the time of such termination shall remain payable to Packy. Such termination will not limit any other right by Packy under contract, tort or any other legal theory to pursue any claim or cause of action against the Admin for violating these Terms, including without limitation, monetary damages, injunctive relief, attorney's fees and court costs.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Account Discrepancies. </span>Admin may contact Packy by e-mail at <a href=\"#contact_mail#\">#contact_mail#</a> concerning charges or other questions regarding the status of Admin's account. However, if Admin's account-related questions are not satisfactorily resolved within fifteen (15) business days of Admin's first calling or sending an e-mail to Packy Support regarding such questions, Admin must write to Packy at: PACKY.IO, Inc., 111 Main St. El Segundo, CA 90245, delivered by United States mail.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may Admin dispute any charge or account billing hereunder later than ninety (90) days after such questionable account billing or other discrepancy should have been or could have been reasonably discovered by Admin.
